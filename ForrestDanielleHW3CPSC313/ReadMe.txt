To distinguish between each team, I used different colors.The colors 
for each line were chosen at random between 0 and 175 
for each RGB value. I limited the number to 175 because I wanted 
to make sure the colors showed up in the white background. 
I increased the strokeWeight when the team was selected. Additionally, 
I included team name text in the white space of the graph, so the user
can clearly see the team name.
